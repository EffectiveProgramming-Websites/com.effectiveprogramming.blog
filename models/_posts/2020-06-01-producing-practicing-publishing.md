Time is a finite resource, have you thought about how well you are managing it? Do you think that proactively balancing your time across some set of dimensions might improve or maximize your odds of success? Consider organizing your time in terms of the following three Ps:

- Producing
- Practicing
- Publishing

## Producing

This is how much time you spend _making_ things that can be seen or used. Writing songs, developing software, manufacturing shovels, playing basketball games, performing dance routines, providing web services - you name it. In a given week, how much time do you spend _making_ things?

I think this is the most important P because I think it drives the relative balance of the other Ps. Producing things regularly helps maintain focus on outcomes while also providing visibility into current position and heading. And since Production capability changes over time, _constantly_ Producing serves as a up-to-date reality check.

I don't think I can overstate how important Producing is. While the relative balance of time spent Producing should vary over time, it should never be absent.

## Practicing

After Producing something, one tends to gain a sense of some skills or capabilities that, if improved, could lead to a higher level of Production. Practicing is the deliberate, focused exercise of a particular facility that ties into improving Production.

For example, basketball players showing up at 5:00am to practice layups and free throws. Baseball players spending their weekends at batting cages to practice swinging. Developers read about and build examples to understand and exercise their understanding of new language or tech stack features.

An interesting aspect to keep in mind is that Practice is generally an approximation. A Practice routine applies the Scientific Method by varying something specific while holding other aspects constant. Good Practice routines simplify the situation to push specific skills beyond the current threshold.

Similar to Producing things, the relative time spent Practicing should vary over time. It may be advantageous for a budding guitarist to spend more time playing through songs vs practicing scales whereas an accomplished pianist may gain more value drilling into scales over playing through many pieces.

## Publishing

This is how much time you spend communicating or sharing your experiences with others. The electronic hobbyist may never need to publishing anything while the software contractor may want more people to be aware of their experiences. Publishing benefits both you and others.

Publishing can take many forms. Blogging, vlogging, podcasting, books, forums. Find the medium that works for your purpose.

## Application

So step back and revisit how you spent your last week. How you spent your last month. Try and understand how most everything you did fits into one of these buckets and then consider how intentional you were. Then, work on being more intentional.
