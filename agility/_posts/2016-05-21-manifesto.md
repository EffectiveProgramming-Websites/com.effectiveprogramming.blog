Take a minute and re-read the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) - but differently. Read it, not as a letter to the enterprise, but as a letter to the development team. Read the manifesto again and imagine that each line is, at its deepest level, based on trust - that must be earned (again). Consider the manifesto a plea to developers to perform the things on the left at a level that obviates the things on the right.
