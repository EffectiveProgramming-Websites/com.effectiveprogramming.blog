title: Agility is a Positioning Exercise

Have you had trouble wrapping your head around all the Agile mumbo jumbo coming out for the different camps? If so, I've a fresh perspective that I'd like you to consider. What if you considered Agile, not so much as a set of practice as much as a _positioning_ exercise. Consider, for example, a quarterback strategy to _stay in the pocket._ The actual play changes every time the ball is hiked but the goal of the front line remains the same, create a "pocket" for the quarterback to work in.

Take a blank piece of paper and draw an irregularly shaped circle in the center - roughly 2 or 3 inches in diameter. We'll call this the _pocket,_ a protective bubble. Draw 8 little circles randomly in the circle - these represent the members of your team. Draw 3 or 4 circles each on the left, top, right and bottom of the circle - these represent the stakeholders and in general, entities that require services from the folks inside the circle.

Now, draw little arrows or wind streams directed at the circle border - both from the inside and the outside. I am suggesting that agility is epitomized when these 2 forces are in balance. When there is just internal tension to support a pocket with a consistent surface area

Admittedly, the word _tension_ doesn't quite fit reality. I am not suggesting us and against them mentality here. What I am suggesting though is that the team needs to decide on some space and then needs to protect it. That doesn't mean the team can decide on that space in a vacuum. That space needs to be realistic. It mostly likely will be a blend of ideal with practical.

The goal then for the team then is 2-fold:

1. to decide on and constantly work to protect the pocket. The pocket is irregularly shaped. You never know what sort of external force might be through against the pocket. The pocket represents your working agreements and a decent amount of your team's energy will be spent on maintaining these borders.
2. to actually be productive within the pocket. Yes, yes, yes - we've got to get things done. We've got to delivery things.

So, as you can see, the work of the team must be dynamic. It must react to which forces are most pressing from the outside. It might need to expect more energy this week on the southwest edge and more energy next week on the northeast edge. To further enhance this visual, consider dividing the circle into pie slices - or maybe a radar graph. Consider nodes at the edge of your radar graph as being your own working agreements - you need to decide how important those ideals are and then, in real time, you need to defend them - by keeping the external forces honest.
