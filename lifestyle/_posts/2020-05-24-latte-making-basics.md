A latte consists of a shot of espresso and steamed milk. Let's review some basics:

- the beans
- the grind
- the shot
- the milk

### The Beans

Can you use _coffee_ beans when making espresso? Yes. And to be clear, beans labelled as _espresso_ beans are, in fact, _coffee beans._ Making espresso has to do with the _process_ and not the bean. Certain coffee beans tend to fare better than others given the peculiarities of the espresso making process. When you see coffee beans labelled as _espresso_ beans, you've come across a coffee bean that someone somewhere liked when used as part of the espresso process. Espresso has been around for quite a while now and many roasters prepare beans specifically to maximize flavor within the espresso making process but at the end of the day, they are all coffee beans.

You can purchase pre-ground beans or grind them yourself. Some of the signature flavors are lost within a few minutes of grinding so I find it important to grind the beans as close as possible to actually making the latte. Once you destroy the protective shell and shred the bean internals, you expose the core of the bean to the outside world and the flavors start to dissipate. Grind the beans yourself if possible.

I used to drive around town looking to purchase beans roasted _yesterday_ but after questioning a few different boutique roasters and coffee shops, I learned that most beans peak in flavor 1 to 2 weeks after roasting. This is related to the process of degassing. Don't use beans until 7 to 10 days after the roast date.

Coffee beans sold in most stores do not typically include a _roasted on_ date. Instead, bags of beans bound for grocery stores include some sort of _sell by_ date. This is not typically the case when buying directly from the roaster or coffee shop where the beans usually include the roast date. They are clearly not the same and unless you contact the roaster directly and get confirmation on how to reverse engineer a sell by date to arrive at a roast date, be careful. I don't typically buy from the grocery store because this missing bit of information is significant to my latte making process. Avoid beans that do not include the roast date.

After the degassing period the peek bean flavor does start to decline but in general, it does so at a rate much slower than the degassing rate. This means you can use beans for on up to a month post their roast date. In fact, it is this cadence that drives how I buy beans. I tend to go through a 12oz bag each week and so to save on shipping, I buy 2 bags at a time, every 2 weeks. I try, but don't always succeed, to wait 7-10 days post the roast date before opening a new bag and under my current subscription, and if I'm getting my bags fairly fresh, that means the 2nd bag is usually opened 17ish days post the roast date. Given vacations and fluctuating weekly usage, I sometimes shift the subscription date a bit or moderate how much I'm drinking in an effort to maximize the delivery cadence. Manage your delivery and consumption cadence to be maximize bean flavor.

Don't take my word for it. Experiment with these dates. Find what works for you. Taste the beans. Professional coffee shops taste their beans every morning and decide what and when to start grinding beans for customers. It is much easier for coffee shops to make real time decisions as to when to start using beans. That is tricky to pull off in a home setting so I don't tend to do that - but do experiment and get to know your beans and how the aging process affects them.

### The Grind

As mentioned earlier, lattes require a shot of espresso and as such, most espresso experts agree that the _grind_ is most important aspect of the final product. The idea is that a superb grind can compensate for ok beans and an ok machine. Hard to do in a home setup but if you're going to spend your money where it counts, spend it on a good grinder.

Espresso, more so than coffee, requires a much finer grind then pour-over coffee. And because of how an espresso shot is tamped and packed into a portafilter, the quality and consistency of the grind has a huge impact on the final flavor. Think of the grind quality as _enabling_ the machine to pull a great shot. The better the grind, the less work/lower quality/cheaper the actual espresso machine need be.

I started off with a decent specialty grinder but for various reasons, quickly made the jump to a heavy-duty commercial grinder and I never looked back. It was an expensive purchase but was nice to simply remove that daily concern out of the equation.

### The Shot

You _bought_ the beans. You've _ground_ the beans. Now you need a machine that can _pull_ hot water across those grounds. To facilitate this, espresso machines typically consist of a water boiler to heat the water, a brew head to dispense water through the grounds, a portafilter to hold the grounds within the brew head, and a basket to form and contain the grounds themselves into a puck.

The ground beans get packed into the basket to form a puck. Baskets can vary in size and acts as a sort of measuring cup. Baskets have fine holes in the bottom through which the final espresso will escape. Portafilters are long levers that hold baskets and lock into brew heads. Once locked in, the brew head is turned on and forces heated water from the boiler through the grounds in the basket. The resulting liquid that expels from the holes in the basket is caught by some sort of cup or glass at which point it is espresso - ready to be prepared into whatever the final drink may be.

The important variables here are water temperature and pressure. Which type of material holds temperature more consistently, a cast iron skillet or a thin aluminum pan? Likewise, commercial coffee shops have an advantage here since their machines tend to be massive. The more machine mass, the more stable the temperature. Commercial shops don't need _instant on_ and can therefore afford to turn things on before opening everyday whereas most home situations prefer shorter warmup times.

In addition to temperature stability, espresso machines have to manage water pressure (as they have to _pull_ water through the basket of coffee grounds you prepared). And as you might guess, pressure inducing systems range from a single $15 part to multi-component systems with parts many times that cost. The goal is not to have unlimited pressure. Most folks prefer shots pulled somewhere around 9 bars of pressure. Don't be fooled by machines that claim to provide 15 bars of pressure. Similar to temperature, the trick is stability throughout.

At the end of the day, these factors are all part of the daily _recipe_. Most coffee shops pull shots ranging from 14 to 23 grams from anywhere between 23 and 30 seconds but do note, these are not hard, fixed values. They vary by day, humidity, bean, age, machines, and more. There are certainly some basic rules of thumb but know that a professional coffee shop will literally _taste_ test every morning, set the machines accordingly, and then continue to moderate the recipe throughout the day. Pulling for too long or at too high a temperature can ruin a good espresso drink so it is important to keep adjusting the various parts of the recipe throughout the day.

For simplicity's sake, most machines focus on consistency but in reality, every machine has a signature profile that reflects how well it pulls off the work it is doing to pull a shot of espresso. For instance, the pump might have a ramp-up time in which case, the beginning of a shot has less pressure then the end. Similarly, a cheaper machine may be able to reach 200&deg;F but may not be able to maintain that temperature for the entire duration of the shot. And in reality, some of these dynamic changes (incidental or intentional) over the course of a shot may actually enhance the shot. Some specialty machines allow you to manage a few of these variables dynamically - something known as _profiling_ the shot. This gets all kinds of complicated, especially when considering that the machine is not likely perfect at adhering to the intended profile - but it can provide a fun way to experiment with the effect that different dimensions have on the final taste.

### The Milk

The final step of preparing a latte is the milk. You've got to _whip_ the milk. You can use an inexpensive whipping tool for this but you'll notice it doesn't quite taste the same as steamed milk. The effect may _look_ similar but it is in fact quite different. Steaming milk uses steam to whip the milk and in so doing, also raises the temperature of the milk. In raising the temperature, the milk will reach a point at which the fat is _rendered._ When you _steam_ your milk, you are _sweetening_ the milk. _Texturizing milk_ as it is often called, is a bit of black magic. Don't take it personally if you don't get it right immediately. It is tricky to get right initially - especially when you consider that different drinks call for different textures. Cappuccinos require a lighter, foamy milk texture whereas Lattes call for a more dense, latex paint quality in the milk.

Some higher end machines allow you to steam milk while simultaneously pulling a shot. The value here is, similar to grinding beans, the closer in time that you mix steamed milk with freshly pulled espresso, the more ideal the taste. As stated above, commercial shops have machines that are so massive that pulling shots and steaming milk simultaneously is relatively easy and fast. Those machines are massive and suffer relatively little temperature fluctuation as water is leaving and entering the various boilers. I like to focus on latte art so to be honest, I let my home machine sit for a bit after pulling a shot to let it get back up to temperature. I could steam simultaneously but in my case, I can see a drop of about 10 degrees after pulling a shot and I'm afraid that drop may affect the texture of the milk I am steaming and since I get much joy from trying to free hand pour latte art, I've just relegated myself to waiting for the temp to climb back up.
