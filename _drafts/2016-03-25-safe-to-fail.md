title: Safe To Fail?
author: LB
pitch: Have you seen the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23safetofail&src=typd">#safetofail</a>? if you have, what does it mean to you? I don't particularly like the hashtag because I think it advocates a way of thinking I prefer to avoid.

## Definitions

One of the biggest problems in this post is defining the word <strong>Fail</strong>. Of course it means something and of course it is a word - but I take issue with using it in particular ways. In fact, I think that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/let-their-words-do-the-talking/201011/words-have-power">Words Have Power</a> and should be used as correctly as possible.

I also don't like to dress up words. When someone tells me #safetofail I think they are dressing up a ugly idea to soften its impact on their lives somehow. Its as though someone is calling them a name and they are countering the name calling by putting a positive spin on the name.

## Estimates

Typically, when someone puts forth effort to reach a goal - and then misses the goal, they might say <q>That was a failure.</q> So then, let's discuss a concrete example of the term <strong>Failure</strong> as related to goals. Specifically, let's talk about <em>estimates</em>.

When establishing an estimate, 

Now, what is the general reaction of developers to estimates. Do they embrace them and then call it a failure when they don't reach them? No, why? Because it wasn't a failure. It may have been a feailure in the business mind, but in reality, the developers would likely consider it a feailure in the esetimation or business side. Specifically, they would blame and discuss the factors that put the before or past the estimate.

So, consider you are the developer and you miss your goal. Consider suggesting that you failed at <em>estimating</em> and predicting the future. Now, how does that sound. You didn't fail at reaching your goal, you failed at executing on your prediction. Now, is that really a failure? Do we call that a failure in software development? Of course not. Estimates are sliding windows - suggested with give and take in mind. Likewise, when trying to achive a goal - if you overreach on your estimate, simply adjust. It makes no sense to say #safetoforecastincorrectly.
